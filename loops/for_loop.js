# JavaScript For Loop: Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

# Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

1.for - loops through a block of code a number of times
2.for/in - loops through the properties of an object
3.for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
4.while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
5.do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

The For Loop
The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:

for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

    text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
  }
