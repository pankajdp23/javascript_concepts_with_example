/*
JavaScript String trim()
The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string:
*/
let text1 = "      Hello World!      ";
let text2 = text1.trim(); //Hello World!

/*
JavaScript String trimStart()
ECMAScript 2019 added the String method trimStart() to JavaScript.

The trimStart() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the start of a string.

ECMAScript 2019 added the string method trimEnd() to JavaScript.

The trimEnd() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the end of a string.
